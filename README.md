##  Project Objective
To analyze patient health data and identify key risk factors contributing to heart disease and diabetes using exploratory data analysis and risk scoring techniques.

##  Why this Project?
Early identification of high-risk patients helps clinicians take preventive actions, improve patient outcomes, and reduce long-term healthcare costs.  
This project focuses on understanding patient risk patterns through data-driven insights.

##  Dataset Overview 
The dataset contains patient health-related attributes such as:
- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Levels
- Glucose Levels
- Smoking Habits
- Other clinical indicators relevant to cardiovascular and diabetes risk

##  Tools & Techniques
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Risk Scoring Logic  

##  Project Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Exploratory data analysis using visualizations

4. Analysis of key risk factors  
5. Risk score calculation to categorize patients
6. Model Evaluation

##  Key Analysis Performed
- Impact of age on patient risk
- Relationship between blood pressure and disease risk
- Effect of glucose and cholesterol levels
- Influence of smoking habits on overall risk
- Distribution of patient risk scores
- ![Feature Importance](screenshots/feature_importance.png)


##  Outcome
The project provides insights into how multiple health factors contribute to increased patient risk and demonstrates how exploratory analysis and scoring logic can support healthcare risk assessment.

##  Installation

This project uses standard Python libraries. To run the notebook locally:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

##  Future Scope
- Apply machine learning models for predictive risk analysis  
- Use real-world clinical datasets  
- Extend analysis with dashboards for better visualization

### Note
This project is part of my learning journey in **Healthcare Data Analysis and Clinical AI**, focusing on building strong foundations in healthcare-focused data science.

This project was created as my first hands-on healthcare data analysis project to strengthen my understanding of patient risk factors and clinical data interpretation.
